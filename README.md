# Tic-tac-toe in Clojure

A (very) rudimentary version of tic-tac-toe, written in Clojure.

I wrote this as my first-ever learning project to become familiar with Clojure,
in order to practice some of the concepts covered in the wonderful [Clojure for
the Brave and True](https://www.braveclojure.com/). 

Expect bugs, anti-patterns (recursion still hurts my head often), etc. I think
it'll be fun to re-implement the game of tic-tac-toe after a year or so of
casual Clojure use to compare differences in implementation.

## Usage
Assuming you have `clojure` and `leiningen` installed, simply clone the
repository and execute:

``` sh
lein run
```

Or, build the project with:

``` sh
lein uberjar
```

and execute with:
``` sh
java -jar target/uberjar/tictactoe-0.1.0-standalone.jar
```
